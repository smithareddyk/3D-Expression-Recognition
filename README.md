import math
import numpy as np:
•	NumPy arrays are used to store and manipulate the 3D coordinates of facial landmarks.
•	Trigonometric functions like np.radians() and np.cos() are used to convert angles to radians and compute cosine values, respectively.
•	NumPy arrays are used to represent rotation matrices for 3D rotations.
•	Matrix multiplication (np.dot()) is used to apply rotations to the original landmarks.
•	NumPy arrays are used to convert data between different formats, such as reshaping data from a flat representation to a 3D representation and vice versa.
•	NumPy's random module (np.random.choice()) is used to select random samples from the dataset.
import pandas as pd:
•	Pandas (import pandas as pd) is primarily used for data manipulation and organization, especially for handling tabular data.
•	Pandas is used to read and load data from files into DataFrames, such as reading BND files in the read_bnd_file() function and loading processed data from directories in the process_and_create_dataframe() function.
•	DataFrames are used to organize the facial landmark data, where each row represents a sample (e.g., facial landmark coordinates) and each column represents a feature or attribute.
•	DataFrames are used to preprocess and transform data, such as translating landmarks to the origin (translate_to_origin()) and rotating landmarks (rotateX(), rotateY(), rotateZ() functions).
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D:
•	matplotlib.pyplot: This module is imported as plt. It is used to create plots and visualizations, such as scatter plots, histograms, line plots, etc.
•	mpl_toolkits.mplot3d: This submodule is imported to enable 3D plotting functionality. It allows the creation of 3D axes for plotting 3D data.
from sklearn.model_selection import  KFold:
•	The KFold class from sklearn.model_selection is used to split the dataset into k folds for cross-validation. It provides methods to generate indices for training and testing sets, facilitating the evaluation of machine learning models across multiple subsets of the data. Here we have done 10 fold cross-validation where the dataset is divided into 10 subsets.
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
•	the imported classifiers from scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, SVC, and DecisionTreeClassifier) are used to create instances of machine learning models for classification tasks. These models are trained on input data and evaluated using cross-validation
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score:
•	The imported functions from scikit-learn (confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, precision_score, and recall_score) are used to compute evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, and recall, respectively, for evaluating the performance of machine learning models)
